# Mini project 2

This is the second project I completed with Responsive web design course. The screen shots are below:

These are the learning outcomes:
1. Gained proficiency in a specific programming language and its syntax. I am extremely confident in my understanding and applying HTML and CSS languages.
2. Improved documentation skills by adding comments to code, explaining functionality, and making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand.

I can already see a massive improvement from the first project in my style of coding and I hope to keep improving in this field.
